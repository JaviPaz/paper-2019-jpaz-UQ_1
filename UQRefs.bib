The model evaluates the ratio of bending to membrane loading in the elements based on the through-thickness gradient of the through-thickness plastic strain. The Cockcroft–Latham failure criterion is adopted, whose parameters are modified according to the length-to-thickness ratio of the shell elements in order to reduce the mesh dependency. This regularisation scheme is validated against experimental component tests on a double-chamber profile in an AA6005-T6 recrystallised aluminium alloy under quasi-static and impact loading conditions. The results show that the model is able to accurately predict fracture initiation under all tested conditions."

	abstract = {Due to the expensive cost of full-scale tests, more and more designs rely on simulation. For highly nonlinear crash simulation, numerical uncertainty is an inherent by-product, which refers to the oscillation of results when the simulation is repeated at the same design or the design variables are slightly changed. This oscillation directly inﬂuences the quality and reliability of the optimal design. This paper shows how these issues can be addressed by proposing a simple uncertainty quantiﬁcation method for numerical uncertainty (noise) and surrogate model uncertainty (error) in the optimization process. Three engineering problems, a tube crush example, an automotive front-rail crush example and a multi-cell structure crush example, are used to illustrate this method. Firstly, the level of numerical uncertainty is quantiﬁed in terms of noise frequency and amplitude, and the convergence study of these two criteria is employed to determine an appropriate data size to describe numerical noise. Secondly, an estimation method considering both numerical noise and surrogate model error is proposed based on the prediction variance of the polynomial response surface. Finally, the tube and front rail structures are optimized according to the proposed uncertainty quantiﬁcation method. It was found that by considering the two sources of uncertainty, the optimal designs are more reliable than the deterministic solutions.},

By nature, the effects of loading speed or strain rates signiﬁcantly affect the structural responses in collisions or grounding. The nonlinear structural responses involving crushing and fracture as well as buckling and plastic collapse are often called structural crashworthiness. The primary objective of structural crashworthiness analysis under dynamic and impact loading is to compute structural deformations or damage and associated reaction forces with time. Subsequently, the relationships between deformations and accidental forces are determined. The absorbed energy characteristics of structures in accidental loads can be calculated by integrating the area below the accidental force-deformation curve.

To provide a more effective design framework for ensuring crash safety, a reliability-based design optimization ({RBDO}) method for vehicle body crashworthiness considering complex parametric correlation is developed by integrating copula functions. An {RBDO} model is formulated for the vehicle body crashworthiness problem based on a finite element model of a vehicle crash. Taking into account the correlation of random parameters, the optimal copula function is selected by the Bayesian method to model parametric correlation and build the joint probability distribution function. An efficient solution strategy is provided to perform the reliability analysis and optimization design of crashworthiness.

In addition, effects of various uncertainty reduction measures (e.g., reducing variability in material properties, reducing error of ﬁnite element analysis) are investigated and tradeoff plots of uncertainty reduction, system reliability and structural weight are generated. These types of tradeoff plots can be used by a company manager to decide whether to allocate the company resources for employing uncertainty reduction measures or allocating the resources for the excess weight to protect against the unreduced uncertainties. Furthermore, relative importance of automobile structural members in different crash scenarios is quantiﬁed.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a framework to incorporate the notion of reliability into crashworthy designs of automotive vehicle components. Optimal design for crashworthiness is a challenging task in itself as it involves time dependent complex interactions among bodies along with material and geometric nonlinearities. Maximum energy absorption in the structure is widely used as a design criteria in crashworthiness designs as long as penetration levels are kept under allowable limits. These designs behave well and are safe as long as loading conditions and material properties are deterministic however failure can happen due to excessive penetration under uncertain conditions. Hence a semi coupled reliability based crashworthiness design methodology is proposed in which independent reliability assessments are done on the designs at various intermediate levels during an iterative design cycle of a crashworthy structure. Reliability index approach ({RIA}) is used to incorporate reliability constraint in the design problem where reliability index is evaluated using first order reliability method ({FORM}). The most probable point of failure ({MPP}) is determined with respect to the maximum allowable deflection of the structure when loaded. The reliability constraint is satisfied by changing global mass of the structure as the maximum deflection of the structure is dependent on the mass of the structure. Finally a non gradient based method called hybrid cellular automata ({HCA}) is used to distribute material within the design domain to achieve maximum energy absorption in the structure. The application of the proposed method will be shown with the help of a practical example.},

	abstract = {Structural optimization has been widely used to improve the crashworthiness of foam-filled thin-walled structures. However, majority of the existing optimization studies to date have not considered uncertainties for simplication. Its associated risk is that a deterministic optimization might deteriorate its optimality and/or violate design constraints when being present in uncertain environment. In this study, a multiobjective robust design optimization ({MORDO}) method is adopted to explore the design of foam-filled bitubal structures. To reduce the computational burden of highly-nonlinear crash analysis, adaptive Kriging models are employed in the optimization process. In this strategy, sequential sampling points are generated over the design space and Kriging models are refitted in an iterative fashion. Based on the Kriging models, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization ({MOPSO}) algorithm is employed to perform the optimization, integrated with Monte Carlo simulation and descriptive sampling technique. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of improving the robustness of Pareto solutions within the prescribed minimum requirements of reliability. Moreover, the influence of varying the emphasis on mean and standard deviation components is also analyzed, which can provide decision-makers with insightful design information.},

The critical crash responses were constructed by unbiased kriging models, and conservative surrogates were obtained via adding safety margin to estimate the crash responses conservatively.

	abstract = {Safety measures in vehicles have been given prime importance by manufacturers and customers. In terms of sales, the market share of motorcycle is very high amongst different types of automobiles. Deaths due to accidents involving motorcycle is also high compared to other vehicles. Considering the impact of improving the crashworthiness of motorcycle frames on safety of the riders, this paper addresses crashworthiness of motorcycle frame under frontal impact force. Modeling and analysis of the motorcycle frame is performed using {ANSYS} {LSDYNA} whereas optimization of simulation results was carried out using Taguchi methods. The diameter and thickness of front members of the frame and material of the frame are considered as random variables. The response variables studied are mass of the frame, deformation at the front end and frame reliability. The reliability of the frame is evaluated with respect to limit state of deformation. The outcome of this study is the designs of the frame which satisfy mass, deformation and reliability criteria. With the optimal combination of variable obtained from optimization study, risk analysis is carried out on the frame in order to understand the relation between deformation and cost of exceeding deformation in monetary terms.},

Results show that the proposed methods are effective for crashworthiness uncertainty analysis.

Consequently, it is essential to account for uncertainties in a systematic manner to generate a robust and reliable design. In this paper, an approach to perform multiobjective, reliabilitybased, and robust design optimisation is presented using a vehicle side impact crashworthiness application. Metamodels have been used in the optimisation process to decrease computational effort. Variations in material properties, thicknesses, loading conditions, and B-pillar heat-affected zone material strength have been considered for the stochastic optimisation. A comparative study of deterministic, reliability-based, and robust optimisation approaches is performed.},

This methodology is applied to the vehicle crashworthiness design optimization for side impact, considering both structural crashworthiness and occupant safety, with structural weight and front door velocity under side impact as objectives. Uncertainty quantiﬁcation is performed using two ﬁrst order reliability method-based techniques: approximate moment approach and reliability index approach. Genetic algorithm-based multiobjective optimization software {GDOT}, developed in-house, is used to come up with an optimal pareto front in all cases. The technique employed in this study treats multiple objective functions separately without combining them in any form. It shows that the vehicle weight can be reduced signiﬁcantly from the baseline design and at the same time reduce the door velocity. The obtained pareto front brings out useful inferences about optimal design regions. A decision-making criterion is subsequently invoked to select the “best” subset of solutions from the obtained nondominated pareto optimal solutions. The reliability, thus computed, is also checked with Monte Carlo simulations. The optimal solution indicated by knee point on the optimal pareto front is veriﬁed with {LS}-{DYNA} simulation results.},

	abstract = {Tailor welded blanks ({TWB}) have been widely applied in automobile industry. This paper ﬁrstly conducts experimental tests to investigate the crashworthiness of three different types of {TWB} hat-shaped structures. Their combinations provide three representative {TWB} conﬁgurations: namely the same material grade with different wall thicknesses; different grades with the same thickness, different material grades with different thicknesses, respectively. Secondly, the ﬁnite element ({FE}) models corresponding to each of the samples are established to perform crashworthiness analysis. It is exhibited that the {FE} simulations are in good agreement with the experimental tests. Thirdly, the surrogate models are constructed to approximate the crashworthiness responses of these {TWB} structures. Fourthly, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the effects of the weld line location, wall thickness and material properties for each segment of {TWB} structures subject to crashing load. The results showed that the wall thickness is most sensitive to the crashworthiness of {TWB} structures. Finally, reliability based design optimization is carried out by taking into account the uncertainties in the {TWB} conﬁguration. The results demonstrate that the optimized {TWB} tubes are capable to improve energy absorption as well as enhance the reliability, potentially being an ideal structure for crashworthiness.},

A very large crude oil carrier ({VLCC}) is assumed to collide with midship region of another double hull (D/H) {VLCC} in right angle (90 deg.). Two collision points for the struck {VLCC} are assumed. One is between Swash Bulkhead (S.{BHD}) and Oil Tight Bulkhead ({OT}.{BHD}), the other is just on S.{BHD}. Damage extent and total absorbed energy until oil cargo tank ruptures in the case of {HDS} are compared with those in the case of conventional material. Critical colliding speed ({VB},cr) is also compared. Effects of {HDS} on absorbed energy and {VB},cr are discussed in detail. It can be found energy absorption by inner shell ({IS}) rupture with using {HDS} is about 2-3 times larger than that with using conventional It is also estimated that {IS} rupture does not take place when a striking ship collides in less than 8kt in the case of using {HDS} although a critical striking velocity in the case of conventional bow is about 4-5kt.},

	abstract = {With the advent of powerful computers, vehicle safety issues have recently been addressed using computational methods of vehicle crashworthiness, resulting in reductions in cost and time for new vehicle development. Vehicle design demands multidisciplinary optimization coupled with a computational crashworthiness analysis. However, simulation-based optimization generates deterministic optimum designs, which are frequently pushed to the limits of design constraint boundaries, leaving little or no room for tolerances (uncertainty) in modeling, simulation uncertainties, and/or manufacturing imperfections. Consequently, deterministic optimum designs that are obtained without consideration of uncertainty may result in unreliable designs, indicating the need for Reliability-Based Design Optimization ({RBDO}). Recent development in {RBDO} allows evaluations of probabilistic constraints in two alternative ways: using the Reliability Index Approach ({RIA}) and the Performance Measure Approach ({PMA}). The {PMA} using the Hybrid Mean Value ({HMV}) method is shown to be robust and eﬃcient in the {RBDO} process, whereas {RIA} yields instability for some problems. This paper presents an application of {PMA} and {HMV} for {RBDO} for the crashworthiness of a large-scale vehicle side impact. It is shown that the proposed {RBDO} approach is very eﬀective in obtaining a reliability-based optimum design.},

	abstract = {The functionally graded property structures, as a relatively novel conﬁguration with higher material utilization rate, have been increasingly captured researcher's attention to date. In this paper, a functionally graded thickness ({FGT}) B pillar, which is characterized by a thicker wall thickness in load-bearing regions and a thinner wall thickness in other areas, is introduced to investigate its energy-absorbing and bending performance. And the reliability-based multiobjective optimization with grey relational analysis is carried out to solve infeasibility created by violation of constraint for conventional deterministic optimization via considering uncertainties of design parameters. Based on the validated ﬁnite element model, the {FGT} B pillar with three conﬁgurations and the corresponding uniform thickness ({UT}) B pillar are compared to explore the beneﬁts of B pillar with diﬀerent thickness layouts. And it reveals that the {FGT} B pillars, especially double functionally graded thickness ({DFF}) with diﬀerent gradient exponents n for upper and lower part, exhibit superior crashworthiness to the {UT} B pillar. In addition, in order to research the distinctness between deterministic and reliable optimization in its entirety, multi-response optimization problems, coupling the high-accuracy Radical Basis Functions Network ({RBF}) and Monte Carlo Simulation ({MCS}), are established to produce a set of non-dominated solutions. The optimization results demonstrate that reliable Pareto fronts slightly are shifted away with diminishing performance from their deterministic counterpart attributable to its considered uncertainties, but signiﬁcantly improve its reliability. Beyond that, a grey relational analysis combined with grey entropy is proposed to strike a desirable balance to the speciﬁc energy absorption ({SEA}) and the peak crashing force (Fmax) from Pareto-set under the condition of satisﬁed intrusion (Ma\_In) constraint. Finally, the optimized result illustrates that the thickness variations of the upper and lower parts of the B column are subjected to concave and linear function distribution, respectively, which can provide some guidance for practical engineering with insightful design information.},

	abstract = {A stochastic design optimization ({SDO}) methodology has been developed to design components of an airframe structure that can be made of metallic and composite materials. The design is obtained as a function of the risk level, or reliability, p. The design method treats uncertainties in load, strength, and material properties as distribution functions, which are defined with mean values and standard deviations. A design constraint or a failure mode is specified as a function of reliability p. Solution to stochastic optimization yields the weight of a structure as a function of reliability p. Optimum weight versus reliability p traced out an inverted-S-shaped graph. The center of the inverted-S graph corresponded to 50 percent (p = 0.5) probability of success. A heavy design with weight approaching infinity could be produced for a near-zero rate of failure that corresponds to unity for reliability p (or p = 1). Weight can be reduced to a small value for the most failure-prone design with a reliability that approaches zero (p = 0). Reliability can be changed for different components of an airframe structure. For example, the landing gear can be designed for a very high reliability, whereas it can be reduced to a small extent for a raked wingtip. The {SDO} capability is obtained by combining three codes: (1) The {MSC}/Nastran code was the deterministic analysis tool, (2) The fast probabilistic integrator, or the {FPI} module of the {NESSUS} software, was the probabilistic calculator, and (3) {NASA} Glenn Research Center’s optimization testbed {CometBoards} became the optimizer. The {SDO} capability requires a finite element structural model, a material model, a load model, and a design model. The stochastic optimization concept is illustrated considering an academic example and a real-life raked wingtip structure of the Boeing 767–400 extended range airliner made of metallic and composite materials.},

In recent years there is a surge of research in this ﬁeld aiming at solving these problems. The purpose of this paper is to review these existing approaches systematically, highlight research challenges and opportunities, and help guide future efforts. Firstly, the {UMDO} theory preliminaries are introduced to clarify the basic {UMDO} concepts and mathematical formulations, as well as provide a panoramic view of the general {UMDO} solving process. Then following the {UMDO} solving process, research progress of each key step is separately surveyed and discussed, speciﬁcally including uncertainty modeling, uncertainty propagation and analysis, optimization under uncertainty, and {UMDO} procedure.

	abstract = {Reliability-based Optimization is a most appropriate and advantageous methodology for structural design. Its main feature is that it allows determining the best design solution (with respect to prescribed criteria) while explicitly considering the unavoidable effects of uncertainty. In general, the application of this methodology is numerically involved, as it implies the simultaneous solution of an optimization problem and also the use of specialized algorithms for quantifying the effects of uncertainties. In view of this fact, several approaches have been developed in the literature for applying this methodology in problems of practical interest.

	abstract = {Uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment has become an active research ﬁeld because a number of factors inﬂuencing energy use in buildings are inherently uncertain. This paper provides a systematic review on the latest research progress of uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment from four perspectives: uncertainty data sources, forward and inverse methods, application of uncertainty analysis, and available software. First, this paper describes the data sources of uncertainty in building performance analysis to provide a ﬁrm foundation for specifying variations of uncertainty factors aﬀecting building energy. The next two sections focus on the forward and inverse methods. Forward uncertainty analysis propagates input uncertainty through building energy models to obtain variations of energy use, whereas inverse uncertainty analysis infers unknown input factors through building energy models based on energy data and prior information. For forward analysis, three types of approaches (Monte Carlo, non-sampling, and non-probabilistic) are discussed to provide suﬃcient choices of uncertainty methods depending on the purpose and speciﬁc application of a building project. For inverse analysis, recent research has concentrated more on Bayesian computation because Bayesian inverse methods can make full use of prior information on unknown variables. Fourth, several applications of uncertainty analysis in building energy assessment are discussed, including building stock analysis, {HVAC} system sizing, variations of sensitivity indicators, and optimization under uncertainty. Moreover, the software for uncertainty analysis is described to provide ﬂexible computational environments for implementing uncertainty methods described in this review. This paper concludes with the trends and recommendations for further research to provide more convenient and robust uncertainty analysis of building energy. Uncertainty analysis has been ready to become the mainstream approach in building energy assessment although a number of issues still need to be addressed.},

	abstract = {The increasing use of surrogate models has widened the range of application of classical reliability-based design optimization ({RBDO}) techniques to industrial problems. In this paper, we consider such an approach to the lightweight design of an automotive body structure. Solving this problem while approximating the complex models (nonlinear, noisy and high-dimensional) with a single metamodel would require a very large and non affordable design of experiments ({DOE}). We thus investigate and propose a methodology of adaptive Kriging based {RBDO} where an initial {DOE} is iteratively updated so as to improve the Kriging models only in regions that actually matter. The nested reliability analysis is expressed in terms of quantiles assessment. Two stages of enrichment are performed. The ﬁrst one seeks to gradually improve the accuracy of the metamodels where the probabilistic constraints are likely to be violated. The second one is embedded in an evolution strategy optimization scheme where, at each iteration, the accuracy of the quantile estimation is improved if necessary. The methodology is applied on an analytical and crashworthiness design problems showing good performance by enhancing accuracy and efﬁciency with respect to a traditional approach.},

To improve cabin safety, this paper developed an analysis and design algorithm to optimise 2D triaxially-braided composite (2DTBC) frame under dynamic crush-type load. The design methodology integrates three concepts coming from several different communities including numerical simulation, sensitivity analysis-based variable screening and reliability optimisation. Based one continuous medium mechanics theory, a basic ﬁnite element ({FE}) model coupled with multiple failure modes is built at the macroscopic level previously. Afterwards, the Sobol’ global sensitivity analysis is performed to derive a design variable importance hierarchy. Finally, differential evolution ({DE}) algorithm is implemented to identify the optimum frame geometry that has maximum energy-absorption capacity. The investigation demonstrates that appropriate redistribution of shape parameters of the frame could enhance its design reliability and crashworthiness, and the higher number of design variables often performs better from the energy-absorption viewpoint.},

	abstract = {A microstructure-based model that accounts for the eﬀect of grain size has been developed to study the eﬀect of grain size on the fatigue life of Inconel 718 alloys. The fatigue behavior of two alloys with diﬀerent grain size was determined by means of uniaxial cyclic deformation tests under fully-reversed deformation (Rε = −1) at 400 °C in the low cycle fatigue regime. The model was based in the determination of the fatigue indicator parameter (based on the local crystallographic strain energy dissipated per cycle) by means of computational homogenization of a representative volume element of the microstructure. The mechanical response of the single crystal within the polycrystal was modelled through a phenomenological crystal plasticity model which was modiﬁed to account for the eﬀect of grain size on the monotonic and cyclic hardening/softening mechanisms. The microstructure-based crack initiation model parameters were calibrated from the experimental tests of the material with ﬁne grain size. The results of the fatigue simulations were in good agreement with the experimental results in terms of the cyclic stress-strain curves and of the number of cycles for fatigue crack initiation. The model did not show any grain size eﬀect on the fatigue life for the largest cyclic strain ranges while the predicted fatigue life predicted was considerably longer in the case of the microstructure with ﬁne grain size for the lowest strain ranges, in quantitative agreement with experimental data. These diﬀerences were attributed to changes in the deformation modes between homogeneous plastic deformation at large cyclic strain ranges and localized plasticity in a few grains at low cyclic strain ranges.},

This paper presents a Bayesian metric to complement root mean square error for selecting the best surrogate model among several candidates in a library under data uncertainty. A strategy for automatically selecting the best surrogate model and determining a reasonable sample size was proposed for design optimization of large-scale complex problems.

This article draws attention to the issue, illustrating the difﬁculties it can cause for road vehicle aerodynamics simulations. Firstly a benchmark problem is used to assess a range of turbulence models and grid types. Large noise amplitudes up to 22\% are evident for solutions computed on unstructured tetrahedral grids whereas computations on hexahedral and polyhedral grid structures exhibit substantially less noise. The Spalart Allmaras turbulence model is shown to be far less susceptible to noise levels than two other commonly-used models for this application. Secondly, multi-objective aerodynamic shape optimization is applied to a fairing for a practical road vehicle which is parameterised in terms of three design variables. Moving Least Squares ({MLS}) metamodels are constructed from 50 high-ﬁdelity {CFD} solutions for two objective functions. Subsequent optimization is successful for the ﬁrst objective, however numerical noise levels in excess of 7\% give rise to difﬁculties for the second one. A revision to the problem leads to success and the construction of a small Pareto front. Further analysis underlines the inherent capability of {MLS} metamodels in dealing with noisy {CFD} responses.},

	abstract = {We discuss the arbitrary polynomial chaos ({aPC}), which has been subject of research in a few recent theoretical papers. Like all polynomial chaos expansion techniques, {aPC} approximates the dependence of simulation model output on model parameters by expansion in an orthogonal polynomial basis. The {aPC} generalizes chaos expansion techniques towards arbitrary distributions with arbitrary probability measures, which can be either discrete, continuous, or discretized continuous and can be speciﬁed either analytically (as probability density/cumulative distribution functions), numerically as histogram or as raw data sets. We show that the {aPC} at ﬁnite expansion order only demands the existence of a ﬁnite number of moments and does not require the complete knowledge or even existence of a probability density function. This avoids the necessity to assign parametric probability distributions that are not sufﬁciently supported by limited available data. Alternatively, it allows modellers to choose freely of technical constraints the shapes of their statistical assumptions. Our key idea is to align the complexity level and order of analysis with the reliability and detail level of statistical information on the input parameters. We provide conditions for existence and clarify the relation of the {aPC} to statistical moments of model parameters. We test the performance of the {aPC} with diverse statistical distributions and with raw data. In these exemplary test cases, we illustrate the convergence with increasing expansion order and, for the ﬁrst time, with increasing reliability level of statistical input information. Our results indicate that the {aPC} shows an exponential convergence rate and converges faster than classical polynomial chaos expansion techniques.},

	title = {Robustness Evaluations in Virtual Dimensioning of Passive Passenger Safety and Crashworthiness},
	abstract = {One of the most important tasks of vehicle development is the steady improvement of passenger passive safety systems. In reality significant result scatter can be observed when performing crash-tests. Cause of this scatter of important vehicle performance variables is scatter of variables concerning the dimensioning of passenger passive safety systems, vehicle structure and testing conditions. A computational robustness evaluation of important result variables can only be obtained by integrating stochastic simulation methods into virtual product design processes [1-2]. Primary result of the robustness evaluations is the calculation of the scatter of performance variables and of the connected probability of achieving safety goals. Secondary result is the investigation of the numerical stability of the models and identification of the input scatter, which is responsible for the output scatter. In this paper the fundamentals of computational robustness evaluation are explained compendiously and the experience gained by the systematical introduction of computational robustness evaluations at {BMW} {AG} [3] is discussed. Because of the complexity of finite element-models their robustness has to be examined with great care. Using a robustness evaluation for the front-crash load case of the {ULSAB}-study an approach for identification and quantification of numerical noise is presented.},

	abstract = {Rising complexity of industrial development in the automotive industry is leading to a higher degree of interdisciplinarity, which is especially true in the virtual design area. New methods and solution procedures have to be evaluated and integrated in the overall process. For example, in car body design process, a new topic emerged recently: the multidisciplinary optimization of car bodies with respect to crash and {NVH} (noise, vibration, and harshness). Because rigorous evaluation of appropriate numerical algorithms is still missing, an intense study was realized at the research center of {BMW}. The results are summarized in this article. Four benchmarks have been studied: (a) a full vehicle model for {NVH} analysis, (b) a simpliﬁed multidisciplinary problem with a single crash case and linear statics and dynamics, (c) a lateral impact problem for multi-criteria optimization, and ﬁnally, (d) a small shape optimization problem was included to demonstrate the potential of transferring the results to the more complex problem of optimizations based on real changes in the shape of the structures. Because response surface methods have already been discussed in the literature and because of their failure in certain industrial cases, the focus was set on the evaluation of stochastic algorithms: simulated annealing, genetic and evolutionary algorithms were tested. Finally, a complete industrial multidisciplinary example from the current development process was studied for the validation of the results.},

The paper details the steps involved the model updating process, including the detection, identification and correction of systematic modeling and/or experimental errors, parameter selection and subsequent Bayesian parameter estimation, and the statistical qualification of those estimates. While parameter estimation and qualification are straightforward computational procedures, the detection, identification and correction of systematic errors is not; it is fundamentally intuitive and requires the expertise and experience of both the modeler and experimentalist. This model updating effort was successful in identifying two systematic modeling deficiencies. The identification and correction of these deficiencies is expected to benefit future crashworthiness simulation efforts at {GM}.},

  abstract      = {Genetic algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in studies of complex adaptive systems, ranging from adaptive agents in economic theory to the use of machine learning techniques in the design of complex devices such as aircraft turbines and integrated circuits. Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications.In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics.Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.John H. Holland is Professor of Psychology and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He is also Maxwell Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and is Director of the University of Michigan/Santa Fe Institute Advanced Research Program.},
